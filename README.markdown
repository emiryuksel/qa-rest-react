## Project Overview

This project is a **Q&A (questions & answers)** web application featuring a RESTful backend built with Node.js and Express, paired with a modern React frontend. It demonstrates a clean architecture for CRUD operations (questions, answers, and potentially users) via a REST API. The project is designed as a learning-oriented full-stack example, emphasizing structure, modularity, separation of concerns, and extensibility.

## Key Features

- Backend built with Node.js + Express, providing REST endpoints for managing questions, answers, and optionally users.
- File uploads and media handling (via `public/uploads` folder).
- React frontend (in `client/` folder) for seamless UI interaction with the REST API.
- Clean folder structure with `controllers`, `models`, `routers`, and `middlewares`.
- Dummy data generator (`dummy-generator.js`) to seed initial data.
- Environment variable configuration (via `config/env/` or `.env`).
- Extensible architecture to easily add features like comments or authentication.
- Licensed under MIT for free use, modification, and distribution.

## Repository Structure

```
root/
  client/                   – React frontend code
  config/env/               – Environment configuration files
  controllers/              – Express controllers (business logic)
  dummy/                    – Dummy data or generator script
  helpers/                  – Utility/helper functions
  middlewares/              – Express middleware (e.g., auth, error handling)
  models/                   – Data models (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize, or JS objects)
  public/uploads/           – Folder for uploaded files (e.g., images)
  routers/                  – Express route definitions
  server.js                 – Main server entry point
  package.json              – Backend dependencies & scripts
  .gitignore                – Files/folders ignored by Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- (Optional) **MongoDB** or another database (based on your model layer)
- (Optional) Environment variables configured in `config/env/` or `.env`

### Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emiryuksel/qa-rest-react.git
   cd qa-rest-react
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Navigate to the `client/` folder and install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables (e.g., in `.env` or `config/env/development.js`):
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/qa_db
   UPLOAD_DIR=public/uploads
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

6. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Q&A UI interacting with the REST API.

## API Endpoints

Below are example endpoints (verify exact paths in the `routers/` folder):

| Method | Route                        | Description                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/questions`             | List all questions           |
| POST   | `/api/questions`             | Create a new question        |
| GET    | `/api/questions/:id`         | Get a specific question      |
| PUT    | `/api/questions/:id`         | Update a question            |
| DELETE | `/api/questions/:id`         | Remove a question            |
| POST   | `/api/questions/:id/answers` | Add an answer to a question  |
| GET    | `/api/uploads/:filename`     | Retrieve uploaded file/image |

## Testing & Seeding

- Use the `dummy-generator.js` script to seed initial data for development/testing:
  ```bash
  npm run seed
  ```
- Test the REST API using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL.
- Test the frontend by creating/deleting questions and answers, verifying changes reflect in the backend.

## Architecture & Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Organized into controllers, models, routers, helpers, and middlewares for clarity and extensibility.
- **File Uploads**: Supports storing files (e.g., images) in `public/uploads/`.
- **Environment Config**: Separates dev, test, and production configurations via `config/env/`.
- **Front/Back Separation**: Independent React frontend in `client/` enables separate UI and backend development.

## To-Do / Potential Enhancements

- Add authentication/authorization (e.g., JWT, role-based access).
- Implement pagination, filtering, and search for questions and answers.
- Add voting or ranking for answers.
- Support comments or threaded discussions under answers.
- Introduce TypeScript for static typing.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines (linting, testing, deployment).
- Create a Docker Compose setup for local development.
- Add frontend state management (e.g., Redux, Context, React Query).
- Enhance UI/UX with Material UI, mobile responsiveness, and theming.
- Improve validation and error handling.
- Add unit/integration tests (Jest, SuperTest, React Testing Library).
